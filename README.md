### Welcome to the Digital Ready Computer Science Bootcamp!

Github.com is the site we will be using to distribute and submit daily assignments and activities. Each student has their own repository (or "repo" for short) that they can both view and edit (this is called "reading" and "writing" in computer science). You'll be turning in your daily wrap-ups here, and can view past lectures and notes as well. Staff can also view every student's repository. 

GitHub is widely used in the tech industry for software development jobs where teams of programmers are working on large projects, involving many different files and updates. We shouldn't have to worry about any advanced features like branches or source control management, but we do want every student to get comfortable with uploading and storing their files in GitHub, so that they can come back to it later.
