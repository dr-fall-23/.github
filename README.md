# Welcome to the Digital Ready Computer Science Bootcamp!

Github.com is the site we will be using to distribute and submit daily assignments and activities. Each student has their own repository (or "repo" for short) that they can both view and edit (this is called "reading" and "writing" in computer science). You'll be turning in your daily wrap-ups here, and can view past lectures and notes as well. Staff can also view every student's repository.
